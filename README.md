## Abstract

Non-native species have the potential to detrimentally affect native species through resource competition, disease transmission, and other forms of antagonism. The western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is one such species that has been widely introduced beyond its native range for hundreds of years. There are strong concerns in the United States, and other countries, about the strain that high-density, managed honey bee populations could pose to already imperiled wild bee communities. While there is some experimental evidence of honey bees competing with wild bees for resources, few studies have connected landscape-scale honey bee apiary density with down-stream consequences for wild bee communities. Here, using a dataset from Maryland, US and joint species distribution models, we provide the largest scale, most phylogenetically resolved assessment of non-native honey bee density effects on wild bee abundance to date. As beekeeping in Maryland primarily consists of urban beekeeping, we also assessed the relative impact of developed land on wild bee communities. Six of the 33 wild bee genera we assessed showed a high probability (> 90%) of a negative association with apiary density and/or developed land. These bees were primarily late-season, specialist genera (several long-horned genera represented) or small, ground nesting, season-long foragers (including several sweat bee genera). Conversely, developed land was associated with an increase in relative abundance for some genera including invasive Anthidium and other urban garden-associated genera. We discuss several avenues to ameliorate potentially detrimental effects of beekeeping and urbanization on the most imperiled wild bee groups. We additionally offer methodological insights based on sampling efficiency of different methods (hand netting, pan trapping, vane trapping), highlighting large variation in effect sizes across genera. The magnitude of sampling effect was very high, relative to the observed ecological effects, demonstrating the importance of integrated sampling, particularly for multi-species or community level assessments.

### [code/](./code/)

Contains all code to process data, fit models, and generate figures and results shown in the manuscript. note that the raw data processing files will not run successfully using the files on GitHub, as many of the raw data sets are too large for inclusion on GitHub, or are proprietary (apiary locations). All files will run successfully if run in the order specified by the file names starting from file "3a-main-null.R".  

+ `1a-reclassCDL.R`: script to reclass the Cropland Data Layer into the five categories shown in Figure 1 that were used in subsequent analyses (will not run successfully). 
+ `1b-mdClean.R`: script to clean the Maryland data from Sam Droege and colleagues at the USGS (will not run successfully).
+ `1c-get-apiary-surface.R`: script to extract the metric of apiary density across a 100x100m grid of Maryland to generate Figure 1 (will not run successfully).  
+ `1d-spAbundance-data-prep.R`: prepares data into format for fitting a JSDM in `spAbundance` (will not run successfully).
+ `2-get-inits.R`: script to extract initial values from a previous model fit (will not run successfully).
+ `3a-main-null.R`: script to run the null JSDM without either developed landcover or apiary density as covariates in the model. 
+ `3b-main-developed.R`: script to run a JSDM with developed landcover as a covariate in the model.
+ `3c-main-apiary.R`: script to run a JSDM using spAbundance using apiary density as a covariate in the model.

+ `4a-combineChains.R`: a function to process three chains run separately in `spAbundance` into a single object.
+ `4b-post-process-chains.R`: combines the individual chains that were run in parallel into a single `spAbundance` model object.
+ `4c-extract-samples.R`: script to extract the relevant information from the full `spAbundance` model objects and save in a smaller, more manageable file.
+ `5-convergence-gof-assessment.R`: assess model convergence and goodness of fit for all candidate models.
+ `6-hierarchical-partitioning.R`: script to perform hierarchical partitioning using the four candidate model results.
+ `7-summary.R`: script to summarize all analysis results and generate all figures provided in the manuscript.
